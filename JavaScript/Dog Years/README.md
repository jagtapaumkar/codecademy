# Human Age to Dog Years Converter

This project is a simple JavaScript program that calculates your age in "dog years." Since dogs age differently from humans, this tool provides an easy way to convert your human age into the equivalent age in dog years.

## Overview
Dogs age faster than humans, and their first two years are equivalent to 10.5 dog years each. After that, each human year equals four dog years. This program allows you to calculate your age in dog years quickly using JavaScript.

---

## How It Works
1. The user provides their age in human years.
2. The program calculates:
   - The first two years in dog years (`10.5 years each`).
   - The remaining years, which are multiplied by `4`.
3. It sums up the two values to calculate the age in dog years.
4. The program also converts the user's name to lowercase for display purposes.

---

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for the logic.
- **Node.js** (optional): To run the script locally.

---

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or copy the script.
2. Open the script in a text editor or IDE.
3. Run the script in a browser console or Node.js environment.

## Code Explanation

```javascript
// Declare your age
var myAge = 22;

// Calculate the early years (first 2 years count as 10.5 dog years each)
let earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears = 10.5 * earlyYears;

// Calculate the later years (remaining years count as 4 dog years each)
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
laterYears = laterYears * 4;

// Add early years and later years to find the total age in dog years
var myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

// Store the name and convert it to lowercase
var myName = 'Aumkar';
myName = myName.toLowerCase();

// Output the result
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years, which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
```

### Steps:
1. **Initial Age Declaration**: Your age (`myAge`) is declared as 22.
2. **Early Years Calculation**: The first two years are multiplied by `10.5`.
3. **Later Years Calculation**: Remaining years are multiplied by `4`.
4. **Total Age Calculation**: The sum of `earlyYears` and `laterYears` gives the age in dog years.
5. **Name Conversion**: The user's name is converted to lowercase for better formatting.
6. **Output**: The final result is displayed in a human-readable format.

---

## Sample Output
For `myAge = 22` and `myName = 'Aumkar'`, the output will be:

```
My name is aumkar. I am 22 years old in human years, which is 97 years old in dog years.
```

## Learnings
- **JavaScript Variables**: Declaring and using `var` and `let` appropriately.
- **Math Operators**: Multiplication, subtraction, and addition for calculations.
- **String Manipulation**: Using `.toLowerCase()` to standardize string formats.
- **Template Literals**: Crafting readable output using backticks.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add a user prompt to input their age and name dynamically.
- Build a web-based interface for user interaction.
- Extend the calculator to account for different dog breeds, as aging can vary.
