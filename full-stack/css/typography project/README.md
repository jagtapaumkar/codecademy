## **Changes Made**

### **Font Families**
- Incorporated Google Fonts for a professional and polished appearance:
  - **"Abril Fatface"**: Used for headings to create a bold, artistic impression.
  - **"Merriweather"**: Applied for captions and text requiring a serif style for an elegant touch.
  - **"Work Sans"**: Utilized for body text due to its clarity and modern look.
- Added a custom font, **"Croissant One"**, for the footer to give a unique, personal flair.

### **Font Sizes**
- Used responsive font sizes to adapt to different screen resolutions:
  - Default font size for the website: **18px** (scales down for smaller devices).
  - Banner heading (`h1`): **11rem**, dynamically reduced for smaller screens.
  - Body text (`p`): **1.5rem** with a comfortable line-height of **1.4**.

### **Text Styling**
- Applied bold and italic text sparingly to emphasize important details and captions.
- Integrated drop caps (`.first-letter`) in paragraphs for a dramatic start, enhancing the storytelling vibe.

### **Visual Hierarchy**
- Adjusted headings, captions, and quotes to clearly separate sections:
  - Blockquotes (`.quote`): Large, centered, and framed with decorative borders for a striking appearance.
  - Captions: Styled with italic text and a serif font to differentiate them from body content.

## **Code Implementation**

### **HTML**
The website links to Google Fonts and defines a clear structure for content, with semantic tags and appropriate classes for typography styling. Example:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Abril+Fatface&family=Merriweather:ital,wght@0,300;1,400&family=Work+Sans:wght@300;400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### **CSS**
Typography-related styles are defined in `styles/style.css`:
```css
html {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.journal p {
  font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  line-height: 1.4;
}

.banner h1 {
  font-family: "Abril Fatface", serif;
  font-size: 11rem;
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

## **Responsive Design**
Implemented responsive typography to maintain readability on various devices:
- Reduced font sizes for screens smaller than **1000px** and **680px**.
- Adjusted banner text and layout for better presentation on mobile screens.
